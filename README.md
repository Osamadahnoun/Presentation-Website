# Presentation Website (UI mastery series 3 of 8)

## Description

This project is the third in my UI mastery series. The UI mastery series is a series I created consisting of eight total projects (mini and full projects) to really master my UI development skills. For this project, I've built a beautiful website that mimics presentation slides with css animations.
